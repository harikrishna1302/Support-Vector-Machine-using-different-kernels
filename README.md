# Support-Vector-Machine-using-different-kernels
## 1. Abstract
The main objective is to study the Support Vector Machine with different kernels
using Occupancy Detection dataset and finding good accuracy in all the kernels.
## 2. Data set
 The dataset can be obtained using this link(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learningdatabases/00357/). 
 This is dataset contains 7 attributes (date time, Temperature, Relative Humidity, Light, CO2, Humidity Ratio, Occupancy).  
 This data is collected for every minute and we don’t need ‘date time ‘attribute’, so we remove it from our dataset.
 The occupancy attribute contains 0 or 1(0 for ‘not occupied’, 1 for ‘occupied’) which is the target attribute.
 ## 3. Technologies
 *  Jupyter-notebook.
